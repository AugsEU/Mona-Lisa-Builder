P.S I found this mysterious paragraph in one of Leonardo DaVinci's notebooks, I wonder if it means something? Perhaps a sort of code?

I guard a tiny secret, timeless and sound,
A smile and a mystery, where answers are found.
To unlock the code, think of her name,
Four letters the same, pressed on the frame.
